Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data

This project will introduce you to the key steps of the data analysis process. You will do so by analyzing data from a bike share company found in the San Francisco Bay area. You will submit this project in your first 7 days, and by the end you will be able to:

Use basic Python code to clean a data set for analysis
Run code to create visualizations from the wrangled data
Analyze trends shown in the visualiztions and report your conclusions
Determine if this program is a good fit for your time and talents

This folder contains files for P0: Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data.

Bay\_Area\_Bike\_Share\_Analysis.ipynb - Main project file.

babs\_datacheck.py; babs\_visualizations.py - Supplemental scripts for checking
data wrangling, reporting of basic statistics, and creation of exploratory bar
charts and histograms.

Data is split among twelve other files, organized into three sets of four files
each. Prefixing each set is one of three datestamps, showing the end month for
each data collection period (201402, 201408, 201508). Suffixes for each file
indicate contents:

\*\_README.txt - Information about contents of data files.

\*\_station\_data.csv - Basic information about station locations and
capacities.

\*\_trip\_data.csv - Information about each trip taken using the bike share
system.

\*\_weather\_data.csv - Weather information by day for one station in each
city in the bike share program.
